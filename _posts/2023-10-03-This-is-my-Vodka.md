Well, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME .. I'm 50 ! üéÇüéâüéâ  
This is my October round up of 2023 so far üòÆ

Well, crikey, I've been busy this year, running a business ( [Central Communications](https://www.centralcomms.nz/){: target="_blank"} ), dating (more on that later üëß), parenting a dog üê∂, camping ‚õ∫, and a massive family holiday üõ¨.  
So let's get on with it ....

## Penny update
Penny is now (as of today) 46 weeks and 6 days old!  
She' a big dog now, not a puppy.  

She's completed puppy school (and made a best friend called Willow while there), completed a term of obdience school, had a her first night camping with her friend Willow ... time for a video ü•∞

I'm loving her to bits, and she makes the best companion.  

Here's some pics:

## The Grandies ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è 
### Kashious
Kashious turned 2!  
He's a great kid, he's so much fun ü§™

### Kaiden
YAY!!!! Grandson number two!!!!  
Welcome to my world Kaiden.  
Born 30th January, what a bundle of cuddles.

## Chuck Norris
Well, the truck has gone though some massive upgrades.  
Most notably is the winch and winch bar on the front.  

I had help importing a Max Generation II winch bar from Australia.  
Then proceeded to go through the low volume vehicle certification process.  

This wasn't as hard as I imagined, but it made me nervous for a while; I could've ended up with an illegal truck. üòß

{% include thumbnail.html img="kitted out truck 2.jpg" %}  

I've also installed some drawers in the back, a UHF radio, a cool GPS device (Garmin Overlander), an awning, some more lights, some front brush bars.  
Crikey, what a year of mods, and I'm not finished!  
The tent will get an upgrade pretty soon.  

Oh yeah, and the hard lid was removed, and replaced with a canopy from [Xplora](https://xplora.co.nz/){: target="_blank"}

Karen (my sister) and her family came to NZ for a holiday.

They were kind enough to let me tag along with their NZ holiday.  

First stop, Christchurch.  
We stayed in a nice hotel.  
Went to the antartic centre....

It snowed while we were there, and I woke to a snowy scene one morning....

What a wild holiday, thanks heaps Karen and Family.  

### Whakapapa
While on the topic of holidays.  
I've had one day at Whakapapa this year, and I don't think I'm going to make it back again this year.

## Ami 

So, as I mentioned previously I took Penny to puppy school.  
She met a best friend, Willow, and well, I met a new lady.  

This is Ami.  
{% include thumbnail.html img="Ami Main.jpg" %}  

Since April, when we first got together, we have been touring New Zeland as much as possible.  
Ami has absolutely been the highlight of 2023 for me. üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®  
or Kaiden ..... oh tough call. üë∂
