> NOTE
>
> The IRM command in PowerShell downloads a script from a specified URL, and the IEX command executes it.  
> Always double-check the URL before executing the command and verify the source if manually downloading files.  
> Be cautious, as some spread malware disguised as MAS by using different URLs in the IRM command.
