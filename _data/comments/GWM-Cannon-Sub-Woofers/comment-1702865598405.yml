  Just recently had installed a Alpine R2-a160f amplifier and alpine r2-s65
  speakers 4 of them onto my gwm cannon X, and there seems to be an issue with
  static noise coming out of speakers, and whenever I’m accelerating, it makes
  this weird high pitched noise coming out of speakers, I don’t know if I
  installed it wrong, or it’s something to do with the AMP, could be many
  factors leading to errors of speakers doing static noises, even on mute the
  speakers still have it, I’ve also tried doing noise filters but they did no
  help, can anyone suggest what I can do to get rid of this static noises
