message: "I went via the route of fitting the dsp amp from savagetech due to having too much interference trying to use the HPF to RCA converter. Costed me +- $420 nz landed.\r\n\r\nMy layout consists of:\r\n*Savagetech DSP Amplifier RCA out(under driver seat mat)\r\n- This runs the rear speakers only\r\n\r\n*Cerwin Vega 12 inch under seat sub\r\n- This was fitted under the front passenger seat as it was too big for under the rear seat. Also had to machine spacers to lift seat wiring to have sufficient clearance for sub to fit(perfect fit).\r\n\r\n*Cerwin Vega 800watt 2 channel amplifier (under rear seat)\r\n- This includes speaker wiring running all the way to the front doors and left factory wiring untouched(just unplugged).\r\n\r\n*Cerwin Vega 6.5 inch HD series split system(front only)\r\n- This includes 6.5 inch speaker adaptors from ali express.\r\n\r\nThis was quite the process to install but well worth it. the sound quality is superb and super loud."
