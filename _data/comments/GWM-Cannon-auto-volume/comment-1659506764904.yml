message: "Hi Paul, \r\n\r\nI wonder if you have any issues with this, my Cannon L never saves my radio station that I have set in my collection and every time I get into the car I have to change it over to my preferred station. is there a way to set this so that my favorite station comes on every time I turn the car on instead of having to do it manually... and anther note there is the steering wheel controls allow you to toggle between the different media types but you cannot jump to stored radio stations except it does a search for the next closest station. is there a way to change this thanks."
