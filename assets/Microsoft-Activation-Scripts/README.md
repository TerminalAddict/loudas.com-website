> [!NOTE]
>
> - The IRM command in PowerShell downloads a script from a specified URL, and the IEX command executes it.
> - Always double-check the URL before executing the command and verify the source if manually downloading files.
> - Be cautious, as some spread malware disguised as MAS by using different URLs in the IRM command.
