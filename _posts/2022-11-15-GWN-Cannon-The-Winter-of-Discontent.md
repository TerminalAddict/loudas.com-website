After a few months of not blogging I thought it time to do a "catch up" blog of what's been going on in life.  
The truck has been completely repaired after the damage I did at Woodhill.  
I've bought a roof top tent.  
My passenger seat is empty again. 🙄

# The GWM Cannon repair
So, yeah ... I did a fair bit of damage at Woodhiil; lots of panels were bashed, almost all of them.  
  
Shout out to the team at [Bernie Fama Panel and Paint](https://www.berniefama.co.nz/){: target="blank" }.  
They did a wonderful job of repair, and my truck is back to it's previous glorious state.  
  
Also, and shout out to [Hamilton Stripes and Signs](https://www.stripesandsigns.co.nz/){: target="blank"}.  
They took a photo of my original decals, and then replicated them almost identically !  
Very cool guys!  

# The Roof Top Tent
So, Matt and I went to the [Sika Show](https://www.sikashow.co.nz/){: target="blank"}, which was pretty cool.  
Lots of guns. 🔫  
There was also a couple of 4x4 exhibits, so, y'know, I got thinking. 😆  
  
A day or so later I post in the local Waikato 4x4 facebook group, a low and behold, someone has an ARB Simpson III roof top tent for sale.  
So a small amount of negotiation, and I have a Roof Top Tent (RTT) mounted on the back of the Cannon. 👍  
I'll report back once I've used it.  

# Spare Passengers seat
Teresa and I called it quits.  
Not a whole lot of drama.  
In fact, basically no drama at all.  
  
But, I have a spare passenger seat now. 🤣  
And, I have a spare side of a roof top tent. 🏕️  

# The Video
And of course .. here's a video. 😀
