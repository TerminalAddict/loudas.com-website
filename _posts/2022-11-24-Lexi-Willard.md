Today, after a very short battle with Pancreatic cancer which had quickly spread to other organs, Lexi passed away while on the operating table.  
She was born on the 8th of April, 2014, as an only pup, on a farm in Miranda.  
She was special from the beginning.  
I love her very much, and will miss her dearly.

She has always been a kind and loving dog right from the start.  
When she arrived home on the first day she met the resident cat - A cat named TiVo.  
Turns out they were to be best friends until TiVo passed.  

When I was living with Helen we decided that Lexi was feeling a bit lonely at home, so we hatched a plan to breed Lexi, and keep one of her pups.  
Helen met a Border Collie name Leo, and soon enough Lexi had her first litter on the 28th of February, 2017.  
She had 7 Pups; 2 girls, 5 boys.  
* Arnie
* Flame
* Holly
* Molly
* Ollie (who was renamed to Wilson)
* Spot (who was renamed to Munroe)
* Star

She was a great mum ‚ù§Ô∏è.  
Helen kept Holly.  

In June 2018 Lexi had her second litter.  
She had 6 pups; 1 girl, 5 boys.  
* Phoenix
* Copper
* Oliver
* Rolly
* Tommy
* Duke

She has always been with me, or around me, or in the background, watching me.  
I forget how many nights we have spent cuddling on the couch.  
Crikey, even last night she had her head on my chest while we were sleeping on the bed together.  

She has had some really good people friends in her 8 years, 7 months, 16 days of life:  
* Well ... me üíï
* Georgia Willard
* Ashleigh Webb
* Karen Sims
* Susan Trodden
* Helen Willard (Donnison)
* Sarah Smith
* Paula Withers
* Neville Nunns
* Teresa Norgren

In 2021 our little family grew a bit more when I adopted Petra (the cat) mostly to keep you company while I was at work.  
She'll miss you too. üòø  

Lexi, I'm sorry we couldn't grow old together.  
You have been the most amazing dog; truly a gentle soul.  
My heart is broken. üíî üò¢  

I will remember you for the rest of my life.  

Here are some memories we had together:
