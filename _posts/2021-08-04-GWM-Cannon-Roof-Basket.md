A little while ago I thought it would be great to install a [Light Bar]({% post_url 2021-05-06-GWM-Cannon-LED-Lightbar-install %}).  
Unfortunately, that meant there were consequences for my roof racks, and top basket.  
I started with a cheap black roof basket from [TradeMe ](https://www.trademe.co.nz){: target="blank"}, but I soon decided I wanted a custom roof basket / roof tray made from alloy.

So, let's start right off with the cheap black basket, and the light installed:

It does the job!  
It doesn't look pretty, but oh well. 🥴  
But .. it rusts .. like, 3 months later, I'm starting to see rust .... that sucks!  

So, I hatched a plan, that involved my friend Bipin, some designing, and some welding.  

## The Roof Cage Design
The design was simple enough.  
Made from 32mm alloy pipe, I wanted a tray with two sides.

**SIMPLE**  

Alas, nothing is ever simple.  
Making the basket was easy for Bipin, and his uncle.

And I mounted my light to a cross bar.  

done!

Or so I thought.  

## The Wind!
So, with a circular tube in the wind .. you get wind noise ... lots of noise ...   
*The moaning and the groaning ...*   
*The whistling ...*   
*And more moaning ...*   

More moaning than a ghost having an orgasm 👻🍆💦  

So, I guess I have to make this thing aerodynamic?  
Actually, what I need to do is break the wind (not a fart 💨)  

So, my first attempt was an acrylic "spoiler".  
{% include thumbnail.html img="20210730_133340.jpg" %}  
It worked to re-direct the wind over the top, but often the wind would get behind it, and it would start rattling on the roof.  

I also couldn't figure out a way to keep the spoiler off the roof, it simply wasn't strong enough to hold its own weight; it needed to be supported top and bottom.  

The next step was to call Bipin.  

Bipin !!! 🆘🆘🆘  

## The Solution
We discussed.  
We did some small road/wind testing.  
And we decided that simply "breaking" the wind should be enough.  

Well I could do that be re-relocating my lightbar to the front, and putting in a spacer using 32mm allow!

**SOLVED!**  

# The Conclusion
I'm super happy!  
I think it looks pretty bad ass!  
And it fits in with my white/silver themed truck!
