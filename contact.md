## About Paul
Hereâ€™s a wee bit about me.

Firstly about the name TerminalAddict. Many moons ago I was in a chat room (#musb on freednode) chatting with a bloke called DragonMage. DragonMage is a member of [Mandrivausers.org](http://mandrivausers.org){: target="_blank" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="bottom" title="Mandriva Users"}

Well I was helping some people with Mandrake (or some other distro, I canâ€™t remember) and all my help was telling them to open a command line interface (CLI) which is also called a terminal, so soon enough DragonMage started saying I was addicted to the terminal.

The name developed from there, and I thought it was very appropriate for the following reasons
* I use a terminal for everything
* I <del>am</del> <em>was</em> (see below note) a smoker, which could be terminal, and I am addicted
* I ride motorcycles, which could be terminal, and I am addicted
* Many of my other hobbies / habits could be described the same way

So I stuck with the name, also it wasnâ€™t being used anywhere, by anyone else, which is pretty amazing in this day and age.

Here's a couple of ways you can get in contact with me:

<small>I've fought with smoking most of my life ðŸ˜¥ <br />
I've been smoke free since November 2019. I stopped in February 2015, then picked up the cigs agains during my Helen drama. When I finally left Helen, the next month I stopped smoking, and haven't smoked since (except for a couple of drunken nights when someone handed me a lit cigarette).</small>
