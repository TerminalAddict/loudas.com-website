  Hey Paul, did you have you use aftermarket speaker spacers for the
  replacements or were they direct screw-in for aftermarket replacement? Also
  thanks for providing an helpful overview of your setup as well, always
  appreciated when you find different mods and tips for your own vehicle (I've
  found this originally from your auto-volume YouTube video so thanks for that
  find too, I had just assumed I was stuck with it).
