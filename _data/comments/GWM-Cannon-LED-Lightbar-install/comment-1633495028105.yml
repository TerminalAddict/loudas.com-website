message: "Hi Paul your Cannon Ute looks great, my daughter has just bought one (Australian) and asked me to install some driving lights my reply was no problems ( thatâ€™s what I thought) on installing two led light bars on her nudge bar and wiring up the lights back to the relay installing permanent active from the battery . 2 earths to both lights and relay I went to install the switch and the same issue that you had was mine as well. So my long question is why 2 wires for the switch connection on the relay you state the yellow/ green and the red which one do you use as terminal 86 (white wire if you like) only requires one active in our case to donate high beam I am confused. Normally I would just splice into the high beam active and run that through a switch that would connect to terminal 86 the  combination of the 2 wires has me lost ! \r\nAny assistance would be great."
