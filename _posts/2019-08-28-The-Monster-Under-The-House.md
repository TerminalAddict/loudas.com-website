So just like in [The Fishtank Rebuild Project]({% post_url 2019-02-13-The-Fishtank-Rebuild-Project %}), and in [Aquariums are the best]({% post_url 2018-02-11-aquariums-are-the-best %}) ... I like fish.  
This is the story of how I ended up with a monster under the house.

Well, lets just start with a picture of the monster !!!  
{% include thumbnail.html img="Datnoid.jpg" %}

## Let's begin - The idea hatches
So Helen started employment this year, so her clinic room got turned into a "Helen hobby" room.  
I think she has settled on the name "The loft".  
She plays piano, meditates, does some yoga, etc etc.  

Of course I want a room a too ðŸ˜‚  

So Helen and I hatch a plan to turn a lean-to, ex-carport, half finished, under the house room, into a Den.  
It started as a room with two walls (not four), a dirt floor, and an iron roof.

## The hardwork over 3 months
So 3 months of hard work !!! Concreting, building, gibbing; all stuff I have never done before.  
Nor has Helen!!

We learnt how to mix and pour concrete, drive diggers, build internal walls, hang gib, do electrical work, install a door.  
Like ... crazy man! ðŸ¤ª

## The initial Goal
So to start with I wanted somewhere I could play guitar, loudly, and get myself a monster aquarium.

I planned to build an aquarium from scratch, maybe a plywood aquarium, but there was a tonne of research!  
During my research a 1400L glass aquarium came up for sale, for less cost than the cost of materials!  
So of course I bought it.

Fortunatley Helen and I had finished building the Den when this tank came up for sale.

## The Move
Moving a 2400mm x 1000mm x 600mm size fish tank is quite difficult!  
So I rope in help from Matt again, hire a truck, and head to Auckland to pick up this monster tank.

A few guys turn up in Hamilton (which I don't know!) to help move the thing into place. great!!!!

It's heavy !! like really heavy ! .. 260kgs of glass !! that heavy !

## Status update
the room has been running for a while, as has the tank.  
I've had some deaths ðŸ˜¢ (A Delhezi, and an Arowana .. my absolute favourite fish in the hobby ðŸ˜ž ðŸ˜­ )  
I've had some troubles with filtering. The tank came with a sump that wasn't quite good enough. I now have a Fluval FX6 working along side the sump.  

I'm starting to play with other ideas to make the room cool.  
One idea (because I love gadgets and tech) is to install some [wifi smart bulb](https://makelifeclick.com/lifx-bulb-review-a19-a60-in-e26-27-b22-alexa-google-abode/){: target="_blank"} thingees for some cool lighting, that feels very "Paul", and a bit nerdy ðŸ¤£
