Bill Hohepa and the team at [Keppler's](https://keppler.co.nz){: target="_blank"} gave us an invite to come along to drive WhangamÃµmona road.  
The brief was simple (none of us having done that road before), it'll be about 5 hours, bring your own lunch.  
Boy was that wrong! ðŸ˜…  

So, I love WhangamÃµmona. I love the road, I love the hotel. I ridden State Highway 43 to WhangamÃµmona on every motorcycle I've owned.  
This time it was the truck's turn!  
And this time I was doing WhangamÃµmona roaad, which IS NOT State Highway 43!  

I did some research before I left of course.  
WhangamÃµmona road is described as a difficult track, prone to slips, and dangerous obstacles many metres above a river, with steep drop offs.  
Great !

I turned up with all my rescue gear (snatch straps, max tracks, shackles, air compressor, etc etc).  
Some of the guys turned up wearing Vans shoes. ðŸ™ƒ  
Being unprepared is an understatement!  
I don't blame the guys, they had been told it would be a nice drive in the bush for lunch.  
Most had road tyres on; heck we even had a 2 wheel drive Cannon turn up.

Anyway, we set off, got stuck, rescued each other, then got stuck again .. .repeat. ðŸ˜¬

And yep, a couple of the bog holes we had to get winched through (yes, I'm thinking about a winch again ðŸ˜œ).  
The week since, I've lifted the truck.  
I put Dobi springs in the front, and lifting blocks in the back.

I had a great time, albeit pretty exhausted at the end.  
I didn't suffer any significant damage, but all other trucks did. ðŸ˜§  

Yes I'd do it again ðŸ¤ª
