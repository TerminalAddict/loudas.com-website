message: "Here's a crazy update \U0001F92A <br />\r\nAlmost 2 years since I left Helen, she dropped some of my \"things\" with a mutual friend.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow that might seem nice, but here is why it's not: <br/>\r\n* She mas made contact directly with me in May 2021 about some junk mail, why now include a friend (probably coz she's lonely and wants an excuse to a: keep in touch with the friend, and b: engage with me again). See below: She has recently broken up with yet another man (she leaves a trail of them behind her).\r\n* She is still in contact with my family. If she doesn't want to talk to me, why not go through family, rather than involve a friend?\r\n* I'm still in contact with her family, she could have asked one of her daughters to contact me?\r\n* I've been gone 2 years. Clearly what ever the stuff is, is not important to me (a fishing rod was mentioned). \r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The fishing rod</strong><br />\r\nThe story behind the fishing rod needs explaining.<br />\r\nAs I was packing my stuff up 2 years ago to leave, she made a huge deal about \"her\" fishing rod.<br />\r\nIt was hers! I wasn't to take it .. she watched like a hawk, while I packed up my fishing gear, and then checked after I was gone with me \"You haven't taken my fishing rod have you?\"<br />\r\nSo why give me a fishing rod?< br/>\r\n<br />\r\nHere's where knowledge of narcissism helps.<br />\r\nThis allows her to do some things in the future:  \r\n* Show how wonderful she is to her friend, because she returns \"my stuff\", after all, why would she have a fishing rod, it must belong to Paul.\r\n* Make contact with me in the future to ask for the fishing rod back, because she made a mistake.\r\nNow this last point has two possible plans for attack from her:\r\n* I throw out the fishing rod; that gives her ammunition to point out what an arsehole I am. or,\r\n* Engage with me again, and weasel back into my life.\r\n<br />\r\nOf course all this behaviour can very easily be explained away, or just flat out denied.<br />\r\nAnd pointing it out to her is just what a narcissist wants, to engage, so they can gain control over a person.<br />\r\nRecently I read a story written by her detailing how I called her \"selfish\", and didn't allow her to do things she wanted to do. <br />\r\nand in the very next paragraph shew writes she broke it off with a bloke recently because he wanted to spend one day with her, but she wanted to paint her fence. <br />\r\nInteresting note: before I left I told her \"Your house has some power over you! You constantly choose your house over good relationships with people.\". <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>anyways ... </strong>\r\nI want to write this down, because I know it will come up again .. narcissists never stop."
