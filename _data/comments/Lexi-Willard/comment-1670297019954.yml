  hey paul  -Craig here (Safari owner who ventured into the Woodhills forest
  with you)  gutted to hear about Lexi ;  Ive only had my dog Lil Biscuit for 2
  years;  and she is so important to us  (like kid like important - actually my
  23 year old daughter is a little jealous now that I refer to lil biscuit as my
  youngest daughter ).  With relationships ending  - what an absolutely shite
  time to lose your best mate. I think the only thing to do is go and get
  another dog who will never be the same , but then thats what will make the
  next adventure /chapter that much cooler.  On a more boring note, it was great
  to see you have got the cannon all back shiny and new. I never fixed the door
  on my truck   - figured it will be a reminder to myself to not be a dickhead.
  speaking of 4wd , the club is off out to Karamu 4wd trail this weekend (sat) 
  ; if you need to get out of the house and have some company from a motley crew
  of 4wd enthusiasts - then you should come along . see ya mate  , take care 
  and dont be a stranger  - hope to see you at the next cozzie club meeting /
  event  (ps. bummer about the 42 traverse !  ive never done it and now there is
  a huge slip)
