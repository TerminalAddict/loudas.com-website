As part of a GWM Cannon owners group (which I also moderate) I see a lot of Cannon's doing things in NZ.  
Not very many of them do 4wd stuff.  
Along comes Mitchell Devonshire, who bought a kitted out Cannon from Northland auto's, then proceeded to do a couple of runs up Takapari Road.  
I want in on that action .... let's go üòÅ  

So, Teresa had some family business to attend to in Wellington, so we planned a Friday night drive to Waipakahi River, then Saturday morning to Wellington, then Sunday morning to Takapari road.  
Beyond that we didn't really have any plans.  

## Friday night

So back to Waipakihi road we go for a quick stop just for Friday night.  

## Saturday
Saturday morning we truck down to Wellington, remembering to stop at [Viv's Kitchen](https://vivskitchen.co.nz){: target="blank"} in Sanson for breakfast.  

We did a wee drive by my grand fathers house on Tirangi road in Wellington.

## Sunday

Sunday morning, up for breakfast at McDonald's üçî  

### Takapari Road
Takapari Road is an advanced mountain bike track that climbs for 16 km to the top of the Ruahine Range and offers great views on a clear day to the coast on both sides of the North Island.  
Takapari Rd includes an 11 km climb up to A-Frame Hut and a further 6 km to the road-end. The road steepens and becomes rougher as you climb through shrubland. It then undulates along the ridge.  
This road is one of the only 4-wheel drive tracks on public land in the Manawatu.  

There are amazing views from the top of the Ruahine Ranges.

### Desert road camping
Onward to the Desert road for the night.  
Note: absolutely no dogs are allowed here, under any circumstances.  
I Know someone who stopped to let their dog out of the car for a pee, put a video on youtube, and was found and fined $400 for having their dog on national park grounds. ü§ê  

We setup camp for the night, and watch the sunset behind Mount Ruapehu.

### 42nd Traverse

After a bit of discussion over breakfast, we decided we'd take the 42nd Traverse home.  
I did it in December, how much could it have changed? üôÉ  

Turns out it changed a lot.  

In particular, a big mud hole had developed.

## Summary

A very cool weekend, with some very cool sights.  
Plus my driving was really challenged.  

Must do this again !!!
