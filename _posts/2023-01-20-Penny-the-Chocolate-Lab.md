So, last year Lexi passed away ( [Lexi Willard 2014 - 2022 ‚ù§Ô∏è]({% post_url 2022-11-24-Lexi-Willard %}) ), and I'm still really sad about it ! ü•π  
But, like I've said before, I can't imagine my life without a dog.  
So one thing leads to another, and I end up visiting a Chocolate Labrador litter. üê∂  
Introducing Penny, the Chocolate Labrador.  


Mom (Oxide) is a 4 year old (as of Nov 2022) purebred chocolate lab from Whakatane, and Dad (Cupric) is a 3 year old (as of Nov 2022) purebred chocolate lab from the Waikato.  

Penny, born 09 November, 2023.  

She's going to puppy school, and will be going to some kind of obedience training when she is old enough.  
Let's skip to the good part, the pics:
